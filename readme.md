# UBICOMP 2020 - Social

Hello, this year, [UBICOMP](https://ubicomp.org) will happen **online**. After trying several platforms, we found an oasis of online social interaction in [gather.town](gather.town). Their are the only online platform that enables a myriad of social interactions we only have in real life! We are very excited about this format, and our General Chairs have put together an amazing agenda of [social activities](https://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2020/gather-town/).


Well, this repository hosts the landing page for https://ubicomp.gather, a domain where we hope all participants will gather!
If you have any questions, please, reach out to the XR Chairs at xr-2020@ubicomp.org (yes! XR as in eXtended Reality!)



Kindly,

Danilo Gasques

CO-XR Chair @ Ubicomp 2020
